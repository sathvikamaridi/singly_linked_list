# ðŸ§© Singly Linked List Operations in Java

This repository includes various singly linked list programs written in Java, demonstrating different types of insertion, deletion, and traversal operations. These implementations are useful for understanding fundamental data structures in computer science.

## ðŸ“‚ File Descriptions

### 1. `Insert.java`
Implements a basic singly linked list with:
- Simple node insertion
- Displaying the entire list

---

### 2. `InsertatStart.java`
Features:
- Insertion at the beginning (head) of the list
- Display function to show current list elements

---

### 3. `InsertatEnd.java`
Features:
- Insertion at the end (tail) of the list
- Display function to print the list

---

### 4. `InsertEndReverseList.java`
Enhances the previous insert-at-end logic with:
- Reversal of the linked list
- Displays both original and reversed versions of the list

---

### 5. `InsertatEndDeletebyValue.java`
Adds functionality to:
- Insert nodes at the end
- Delete a node by matching its value (not position)

---

### 6. `SortedInsertion.java`
Implements a sorted insertion method where:
- Nodes are inserted in a way that maintains ascending order
- Useful for maintaining an ordered list without sorting after insertions

---

### 7. `EndInsertDeleteBeginning.java`
Combines:
- Insertion at the end
- Deletion from the beginning
- Mimics a basic FIFO (queue) structure

---

### 8. `EndInsertEndDelete.java`
Combines:
- Insertion at the end
- Deletion from the end
- Simulates typical stack-like behavior
